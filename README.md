# UOCHotels

This pet project is all about DDD, EventSourcing, Microservices and Dockerization in the context of an hotel management application. 

Based on NetCore 2.2, integrated with EventStore, RavenDb, RabbitMQ and AzureStorage. Should be run with docker compose.

If you want to understand the concepts used in this repo I encourage you to check out "Hands on Domain Driven Design in net core" book by A. Zimarev. Disclaimer: Some classes related to the event sourcing section has been shamesly taken from it!
